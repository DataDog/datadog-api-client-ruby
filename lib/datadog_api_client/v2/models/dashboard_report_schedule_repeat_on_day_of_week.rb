module DatadogAPIClient::V2
  # Defines which day of the week to send the weekly report. If the frequency field uses weeks (such as `1w`), this field is required and defines which day of the week to send the report. If the frequency field does not use weeks (for example, `1d`, `1mo`), then this field must be `null` (if provided). If this field is not provided in an update request, and the update request changes the frequency to use days or months (for example, `1d`, `1mo`), then this field is automatically set to `null`.  This field is mutually exclusive with `repeat_on_day_of_month` and cannot be defined in the same request that includes a non-null value for `repeat_on_day_of_month`.
