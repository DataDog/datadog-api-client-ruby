module DatadogAPIClient::V2
  # Defines which day of the month to send the monthly report. If the frequency field uses months (for example, `1mo`), this field is required. If the frequency field does not use months (for example `1d`, `1w`), then this field must be `null` (if provided). If this field is not provided in an update request, and the update request changes the frequency to use days or weeks (for example, `1d`, `1w`), then this field is automatically set to `null`. This field is mutually exclusive with `repeat_on_day_of_week`, and cannot be defined in the same request that includes a non-null value for `repeat_on_day_of_week`.
