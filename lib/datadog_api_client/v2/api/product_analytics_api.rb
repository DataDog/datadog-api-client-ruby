    # Send server-side events.
    #
    # Send server-side events to Product Analytics. Server-side events are retained for 15 months.
    #
    # Server-Side events in Product Analytics are helpful for tracking events that occur on the server,
    # as opposed to client-side events, which are captured by Real User Monitoring (RUM) SDKs.
    # This allows for a more comprehensive view of the user journey by including actions that happen on the server.
    # Typical examples could be `checkout.completed` or `payment.processed`.
    #
    # Ingested server-side events are integrated into Product Analytics to allow users to select and filter
    # these events in the event picker, similar to how views or actions are handled.
    #
    # **Requirements:**
    # - At least one of `usr`, `account`, or `session` must be provided with a valid ID.
    # - The `application.id` must reference a Product Analytics-enabled application.
    #
    # **Custom Attributes:**
    # Any additional fields in the payload are flattened and searchable as facets.
    # For example, a payload with `{"customer": {"tier": "premium"}}` is searchable with
    # the syntax `@customer.tier:premium` in Datadog.
    #
    # The status codes answered by the HTTP API are:
    # - 202: Accepted: The request has been accepted for processing
    # - 400: Bad request (likely an issue in the payload formatting)
    # - 401: Unauthorized (likely a missing API Key)
    # - 403: Permission issue (likely using an invalid API Key)
    # - 408: Request Timeout, request should be retried after some time
    # - 413: Payload too large (batch is above 5MB uncompressed)
    # - 429: Too Many Requests, request should be retried after some time
    # - 500: Internal Server Error, the server encountered an unexpected condition that prevented it from fulfilling the request, request should be retried after some time
    # - 503: Service Unavailable, the server is not ready to handle the request probably because it is overloaded, request should be retried after some time
