module DatadogAPIClient::V1
  # Controls how groups or monitors are treated if an evaluation does not return any data points.
  # The default option results in different behavior depending on the monitor query type.
  # For monitors using Count queries, an empty monitor evaluation is treated as 0 and is compared to the threshold conditions.
  # For monitors using any query type other than Count, for example Gauge, Measure, or Rate, the monitor shows the last known status.
  # This option is only available for APM Trace Analytics, Audit Trail, CI, Error Tracking, Event, Logs, and RUM monitors.
