  # Search logs
  # List endpoint returns logs that match a log search query. [Results are paginated][1].  Use this endpoint to build complex logs filtering and search.  **If you are considering archiving logs for your organization, consider use of the Datadog archive capabilities instead of the log list API.

  # unit tests for submit_log
  # Send logs
  # Send your logs to your Datadog platform over HTTP. Limits per HTTP request are:  - Maximum content size per payload (uncompressed): 5MB - Maximum size for a single log: 1MB - Maximum array size if sending multiple logs in an array: 1000 entries  Any log exceeding 1MB is accepted and truncated by Datadog: - For a single log request, the API truncates the log at 1MB and returns a 2xx. - For a multi-logs request, the API processes all logs, truncates only logs larger than 1MB, and returns a 2xx.  Datadog recommends sending your logs compressed. Add the &#x60;Content-Encoding: gzip&#x60; header to the request when sending compressed logs.  The status codes answered by the HTTP API are: - 202: Accepted: the request has been accepted for processing - 400: Bad request (likely an issue in the payload formatting) - 401: Unauthorized (likely a missing API Key) - 403: Permission issue (likely using an invalid API Key) - 408: Request Timeout, request should be retried after some time - 413: Payload too large (batch is above 5MB uncompressed) - 429: Too Many Requests, request should be retried after some time - 500: Internal Server Error, the server encountered an unexpected condition that prevented it from fulfilling the request, request should be retried after some time - 503: Service Unavailable, the server is not ready to handle the request probably because it is overloaded, request should be retried after some time
  # @param body Log to send (JSON format).
  # @param [Hash] opts the optional parameters
  # @option opts [ContentEncoding] :content_encoding HTTP header used to compress the media-type.
  # @option opts [String] :ddtags Log tags can be passed as query parameters with &#x60;text/plain&#x60; content type.
