  # unit tests for get_event
  # Get an event
  # This endpoint allows you to query for event details.  **Note**: If the event you’re querying contains markdown formatting of any kind, you may see characters such as &#x60;%&#x60;,&#x60;\\&#x60;,&#x60;n&#x60; in your output.
  # @param event_id The ID of the event.
  # @param [Hash] opts the optional parameters
  # @return [EventResponse]

  # unit tests for list_events
  # Query the event stream
  # The event stream can be queried and filtered by time, priority, sources and tags.  **Notes**: - If the event you’re querying contains markdown formatting of any kind, you may see characters such as &#x60;%&#x60;,&#x60;\\&#x60;,&#x60;n&#x60; in your output.  - This endpoint returns a maximum of &#x60;1000&#x60; most recent results. To return additional results, identify the last timestamp of the last result and set that as the &#x60;end&#x60; query time to paginate the results.
  # @param start POSIX timestamp.
  # @param _end POSIX timestamp.
  # @param [Hash] opts the optional parameters
  # @option opts [EventPriority] :priority Priority of your events, either &#x60;low&#x60; or &#x60;normal&#x60;.
  # @option opts [String] :sources A comma separated string of sources.
  # @option opts [String] :tags A comma separated list indicating what tags, if any, should be used to filter the list of monitors by scope.
  # @option opts [Boolean] :unaggregated Set unaggregated to &#x60;true&#x60; to return all events within the specified [&#x60;start&#x60;,&#x60;end&#x60;] timeframe. Otherwise if an event is aggregated to a parent event with a timestamp outside of the timeframe, it won&#39;t be available in the output.
  # @return [EventListResponse]
